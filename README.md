# DiscordTripWire

This project was inspired by BlueHandCoding @VarunPatelius

I used the same components that he did, as well as also using Flask and HTTP requests, although I wrote my own code as a way to learn more about Python and ArduinoIDE. This projects serves as a microphone muter when the sensor is triggered.

This project utilizes an ESP8266 arduino and a python script running concurrently.
